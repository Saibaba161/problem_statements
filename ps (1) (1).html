            <h4>ChildSafety</h4>
            <p>Creating a system to monitor a child's attendance at school and ensure their safety when playing in a specified area involves a combination of attendance tracking and location-based monitoring. Here's how you could structure a solution:</p>

    </div>
    <button class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleVisibility('container6More')">Read More</button>
    
    <div id="container6More" style="display: none;">
        
        <p>Parents want to ensure that their child is attending school regularly and is safe when playing in a designated area. Develop a website or app that monitors the child's school attendance and alerts parents if the child crosses a predefined boundary, ensuring their safety.</p>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Crossing Boundary Alert:</li>
            <p>Define a specific distance (e.g., 100 meters) as a boundary for the child's play area.
        When the child crosses this boundary, trigger an alert.</p>
        <li>Parental Alerts:</li>
        <p>Send immediate alerts to parents through the app or via SMS notifying them of the child's absence from school or crossing the play area boundary.</p>
        <li> Mobile App/Web Dashboard:</li>
        <p>
        Develop a user-friendly mobile app for parents to receive alerts and track their child's attendance and location.
        Create a web dashboard for more detailed reporting and settings.</p>
        <li>Emergency Contact Integration:</li>

        <p>Include emergency contact information within the app, allowing parents to quickly respond to alerts.</p>
       </ol> 
        <ul>
            <li>Considerations:</li>
            <p>Ensure the solution complies with privacy laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.</p>
            <p>Provide clear communication to parents about the purpose and functionality of the system.</p>

            <p>In a traditional way of packing bottles, a cover is used to pack a stack of bottles to transport from the bottle production plant to the filling station. After reaching the filling station, the cover is cut off and it cannot be reused because of tearing. Wooden boxes are not used because returning the boxes increases transportation cost.
